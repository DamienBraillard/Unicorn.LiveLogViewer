**Unicorn.LiveLogViewer** is an extension that adds an embedded log viewer to an ASP.NET Core application.

The log viewer takes the form of an integrated web page. It can access the logs of the host application. Logs entries emitted in realtime and from log files can be displayed.
It can be customized using custom CSS styles and extended to read any log source.  

The project is in active development and some preview version should be available shortly.

Planned features:
* Integrated log viewer with search and filters
* Real-time log interception
* Read log files in log4net/log4j format
* Download of log files
